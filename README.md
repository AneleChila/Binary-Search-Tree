# Binary Search Tree

An Electronic Telephone Directory application in Java, using a Binary Search Tree (BST) as an internal data structure.

The data given has the following format:

51850 Kianna Squares, Terre Haute|552.531.3674|Gislason Kenna
17386 Stephanie Parks, Palm Springs|018-594-2935 x716|Hickle Leone
97354 Queen Squares, Birmingham|(332)985-4036|Moore Gilbert

The fields are: address, telephone number, name. 
Every full name has a last name and a first name. 
The fields are separated by "|". 
The lines of the file are unsorted.

Each record will therefore contain: {full_name, full_entry}, with Full_Name as Key.
